## User Story

As a snake owner in the Richmond area, I want to join a forum where I can share my love for snakes and snake ownership with others in my city. I want to be able to post helpful links for my friends, access what they have posted, and allow for forum members to comment on the links posted. 

## Acceptance Criteria

When I go to the forum homepage, I can either login in with my email and password, or if I am a first time user I can sign up by creating a username, and entering my email address and password. Once I log in I go to a dashboard that features all of the links posted by forum members. When I click on a link, it takes me to that hyperlinked page. When I click on the comments link, I can read members' comments, and add comments of my own.
